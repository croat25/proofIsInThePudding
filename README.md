To Run This and see the results

before we beginning i want to make it clear,

THIS DATA IS NOT MINE AND I DIDNT MAKE IT UP

I USED THE GOVERNMENTS OWN DATA TO PROVE THEY ARE LYING

YOU ARE WELCOME

this is the link were you can find all the gauges urself on a map

i just scraped them and did some data stuff

https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/lcd/

first have npm installed
here is a link if u are novice (https://nodejs.org/en)


install git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


clone the repo, dont overcomplicate it please (https://github.com/croat25/proofIsInThePudding)

run 
```
npm install
```

then run

```
npm start
```

1 key points is that while the number of airports starts leveling off or slowing around 70 percent, you can understand
an airport needs to be built before more plans can start flying

eventually 
build airports
install gauge for "world weather global climate initivate"
increase airplans in the area making more hot air over conceret, 
more per sq km of concrete the greater impact on higher temperature
so its a 1 2 punch but oldest dad i can find via air flights per year currently because 
nobody seems to go back farther then year 2000, if someone knows were i can find this 
data i can pull some scripts on it real quick just not sure were to access it
link: https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-air-passenger-traffic-evolution-1980-2020
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b53abb13-a1b4-46e5-afa7-67330859e78f)

and BAM then the rest makes sense

look at result and match with this website

https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature

you will see the increase of temparture gauges at airports over the years since early 1930's

if you arent living on CNN and under a rock you will probably understand measuring temperature on concert vs
in a grass field is always going to be higher even a small variant will cause a big
ripple effect in data as the more u add and the percentage of airport gauges becomes the majority of the
all operating gauges

like i said proof is in the pudding global warming is a scam

https://github.com/croat25/proofIsInThePudding/blob/main/LookInThisFile.txt

and compare it with the charts, you will see what i mean

YOU CANNOT UN SEE IT, welcome to your first red pill

btw if you open up this one 

allGaugesThatHveBeenTurnedOffLEtsSee.json

and do a ctrl F u will find 167 entries and 32 are from airports which means

out of the 1807 operating of the course over 90 years 167 have been turned off and only 32 of those are at airports

while 1600+ are at airpoints pushing the value up up up up up up up up up and away XDDDDD
32/167 = 19%~

PS dont forget about "cloud seeding" were they dump giant amounts of aluminum which gets  absorbed into the ground
which makes the tempartures also hotter


C02 =  gas of life
⬆️CO2 =⬆️plant growth =⬇️ temps
⬇️CO2 =⬇️plant growth =⬆️ temps

its grade 4 since

doesn't help the gauges used per 100 at airports have been 📈 over time then gauges not at airports

concert = ⬆️
fields = ⬇️
